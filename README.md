# ‚öôÔ∏è CPU Scheduling Simulator (Java)

This project is a simple *CPU Scheduling simulation* written in *Java*.  
It demonstrates how different scheduling algorithms manage process execution and CPU utilization.

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| Process.java | Defines the Process class used to represent each process with attributes such as ID, arrival time, burst time |

## üöÄ Description
The project is designed to simulate how an operating system schedules multiple processes for execution.  
The Process class serves as the foundation for implementing different scheduling algorithms, such as:

- *First Come First Serve (FCFS)*
- *Shortest Job First (SJF)*
- *Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)*
- *Round Robin (RR)*

---

## üß† Key Concepts
- Process representation in Java (Attributes: ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, Waiting Time, Turnaround Time)
- CPU scheduling algorithms 

---

## üß± Example Process Structure
```java
public class Process {
    int id;
    int arrivalTime;
    int burstTime;
    int waitingTime;
    int turnaroundTime;

    public Process(int id, int arrivalTime, int burstTime) {
        this.id = id;
        this.arrivalTime = arrivalTime;
        this.burstTime = burstTime;
    }
}
